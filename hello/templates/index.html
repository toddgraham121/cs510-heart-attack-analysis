    <p>In this project we are going to create a dashboard and use a ML classifier to check if symptoms match up with a MI.</p>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> Overview of Cardiac Disease</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cardiac disease is a lifestyle disease that is more prevalent in countries with advanced economies and higher standards of living, such as the US and the EU member-states, due to the increased prevalence of sedentary lifestyles and processed foods in contemporary diets.</li>
        <li>This dataset is from the 1980s and contains samples from various North American and European countries. We believe our model is robust enough to accurately predict probability of having or contracting cardiac disease at the individual level.</li>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Dataset</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The dataset that we've used is a combination of four databases and it consists of a total of 1025 patients where 312 are women and 713 are men.</li>
        <li>There are a total of 14 attributes, but we will be using just 6 for the dashboard and 8 for the classifier.</li>
        <li>Individual datasets for the attributes can be obtained by just clicking on the attributes, view data (table icon) on the dashboards.</li>
        <li>The details of the chart can be achieved by hovering the mouse on it.</li>

<!--    Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application.  The guide covers the basics of working with Heroku, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.-->
